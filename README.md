Lapce plugin for checking crates.io for updates.

Note: this plugin only manages integration between [crates-lsp](https://github.com/MathiasPius/crates-lsp) and the Lapce editor.

# Usage

Install the `lapce-crates` plugin via your Lapce editor.

If it doesn't work, you might have to install the `crates-lsp` release from [here](https://github.com/MathiasPius/crates-lsp/releases), and configure the `serverPath` to point to it.

Once configured, reload the plugin.
